# Educational Repository
Please see the [README](https://github.com/utk-robotics-2016/utk-robotics-2016/blob/master/README.md) on the main repository

Also, please consult the [wiki](https://github.com/utk-robotics-2016/utk-robotics-2016/wiki) on the main repository.

The purpose of this repository is to store the educational code which is separate from the production code for the main robot. This is a great place for new members to start working on things--some of which may be able to be integrated into the main repository at a later date.

## Getting Started with git
First, install git for your machine. Git is available at https://git-scm.com/, and it works on Windows/Mac/Linux/et al. 

For Windows and Mac, there is a Github client that you may want. It is available at https://desktop.github.com/. For Windows, I can recommend TortoiseGit which may be downloaded at https://tortoisegit.org/.

There is a short git tutorial that I recommend at http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
